## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-03
- **Bug fixes**: Improved error handling in `render_offline` to propagate `process_block` errors instead of panicking.
- **API enhancement**: Added `get_node_by_name` getter to `GraphBuilder` for accessing named nodes.
- **Invariant clarity**: Updated cycle detection assertion message for better readability in PPT mode.
- **Maintenance**: Minor code polish and documentation updates.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-03
- Initial release of the audio graph kernel.
- Core architecture: Graph → Plan → Runtime.
- RT-safe block processing with no allocs/locks in hot paths.
- Deterministic execution.
- Invariants: single-writer, no cycles, rate compatibility.
- Minimal DSP nodes: SineOsc, Gain, Mix, OutputSink.
- Comprehensive tests and benchmarks.
- PPT (Predictive Property-Based Testing) system with runtime invariant logging and contract tests.
- **Correctness hardening**: Reject invalid block sizes, enforce edge directions, bounds checks, phase wrapping.
